\section{Fundamentals of the Vehicle Routing Problem}
\label{sec:vrp-fundamentals}

In this section, we present an overview of the basic concepts and fundamental principles of the \acrfull{vrp}. We discuss the key elements, such as the problem formulation, objectives, constraints, and various VRP variants that have been studied in the literature. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding the context in which Company X's specific VRP variant operates.

In the field of logistics and transportation, the \acrshort{vrp} is a well-known problem. It involves optimizing the routes of a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of \glspl{customer}. The \acrshort{dvrp}, a variant of the \acrshort{vrp}, additionally considers the pickup and drop-off of \gls{customer}s.

A key challenge in solving the \acrshort{vrp} is finding a \gls{feasible-solution} that minimizes the total travel distance while adhering to various constraints. The term \gls{route} refers to the sequence of locations visited by a vehicle during a VRP solution. The \acrshort{mvrp} deals with multiple vehicles in the problem, while the \acrshort{vrptw} introduces time windows for deliveries.

The \acrshort{tsp}, although related to the \acrshort{vrp}, focuses on finding the shortest route for a salesman visiting a set of locations.

The \acrshort{vrp} and its variants, including the \acrshort{dvrp}, \acrshort{mvrp}, and \acrshort{vrptw}, are fundamental problems in the field of operations research and logistics.

\chapter{Problem Description}
\label{chap:problem-description}\thispagestyle{SectionFirstPage}

In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive and detailed exposition of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variant encountered by Company X. The chapter is organized into three sections: "Assumptions" (\Cref{sec:assumptions}), "Definition" (\Cref{sec:definition}), and "Example" (\Cref{sec:example}). These sections collectively offer an in-depth understanding of the problem's scope, context, objectives, and complexities.

\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

The "Assumptions" section outlines the foundational assumptions that underpin our problem formulation. These assumptions are crucial for delineating the problem's boundaries and simplifications, facilitating a clear understanding of the problem's context. Key assumptions include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Homogeneous Fleet}: We assume a fleet of homogenous vehicles with identical capacities and performance characteristics.

    \item \emph{Single Depot}: Company X operates from a single central depot as the starting and ending point for all vehicles.
    
    \item \emph{Euclidean Distances}: Distances between customer locations are calculated using Euclidean metrics.
    
    \item \emph{No Split Deliveries}: We do not allow the splitting of customer deliveries across multiple vehicles.
\end{itemize}

These assumptions provide a foundation for defining and modeling the VRP variant.

\section{Definition}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{sec:mathematical-formulation}

The foundation of our solution lies in the development of a rigorous mathematical formulation for the VRP variant. In this subsection, we outline the objective function, decision variables, and constraints that constitute the optimization problem. We provide a clear mathematical representation that captures the essence of the problem and prepares it for algorithmic solutions.

\begin{align}
\text{Minimize:} & \quad \sum_{i \in N} \sum_{j \in N, j \neq i} c_{ij} \cdot x_{ij} && \tag{Objective} \label{eq:objective-function} \\
\text{Subject to:} \nonumber \\
& \sum_{i \in N} x_{ij} = 1, && \forall j \in N, j \neq 0 \tag{Demand} \label{eq:demand-constraint} \\
& \sum_{j \in N, j \neq i} d_i \cdot x_{ij} \leq Q, && \forall i \in N \tag{Capacity} \label{eq:vehicle-capacity} \\
& \sum_{i \in N, i \neq j} x_{ij} - \sum_{k \in N, k \neq j} x_{jk} = 0, && \forall j \in N, j \neq 0 \tag{Flow} \label{eq:flow-conservation} \\
& x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, && \forall i, j \in N, i \neq j \tag{Binary} \label{eq:binary-variables} \\
& \sum_{i \in N} x_{i0} = n, && \forall j \in N, j \neq 0 \tag{Depot} \label{eq:depot-requirement}
\end{align}


The objective of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is to minimize the total transportation cost, as represented by the objective function $\sum_{i \in N} \sum_{j \in N, j \neq i} c_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}$, where $c_{ij}$ denotes the cost of traveling from node $i$ to node $j$, and $x_{ij}$ is a binary decision variable indicating the route choice. Subject to the demand constraints \eqref{eq:demand-constraint}, which ensures that each customer node is visited exactly once, the vehicle capacity constraints \eqref{eq:vehicle-capacity} that restrict the cumulative demand on each vehicle route to the vehicle's capacity, the flow conservation constraints \eqref{eq:flow-conservation} balancing the flow of goods at each customer node, and the binary variable \cref{eq:binary-variables} governing the usage of arcs in vehicle routes. Additionally, the depot requirement constraints \eqref{eq:depot-requirement} guarantee that exactly $n$ vehicles depart from and return to the depot, with $n$ being the total number of available vehicles. These constraints collectively define the VRP optimization problem, enabling the determination of efficient vehicle routes while respecting capacity and demand considerations.


\section{Example}
\label{sec:example}

Unlike with linear functions, we use a sequence of numbers to describe the slopes of the value function, $\left\{\hat{v}_{i t}(1), \hat{v}_{i t}(2), \ldots, \hat{v}_{i t}\left(|R| \right)\right\}$, where $\hat{v}_{it}(y)$ is the slope of $\hat{V}_{it}$ over $(y-1,y)$ and $|R|$ denotes the total fleet size.
To concretely illustrate the practical implications and challenges of the VRP variant, we present an illustrative example in the "Example" section. This example is representative of a real-world scenario faced by Company X and incorporates the problem's complexities. Key elements of the example include:

- \emph{Customer Locations}: A list of customer locations with specific coordinates.

- \emph{Customer Demand Profiles}: The demand profiles of each customer, indicating the quantity of goods required.

- \emph{Vehicle Capacities}: The maximum load capacities of the delivery vehicles.

- \emph{Time Windows}: Time windows during which deliveries must be made to each customer.

- \emph{Depot Location}: The coordinates of the central depot.

This illustrative example provides readers with a tangible representation of the problem, showcasing the challenges involved in optimizing vehicle routing while meeting customer demands and operational constraints.
